In this site, you will see guides exclusive to aoi.js such as Slash commands guide for example!

If you're a aoi.js beginner or you're just a person who want to learn something, you will find them useful with how much information they have! You can use guide as links to some aoi.js guides if you want!

:::note
It should be noted that this site has no relation to aoi.js team and therefore should be treated as a documentation made by a user.

It is recommended to view aoi.js docs instead in cases where you want information about functions or so!

# What do you need to know
Because the guides can be advanced, it is highly recommended that you have enough aoi.js knowledge to understand them. Although, the guides attempt to simplify the process of understanding them, not everyone can understand hence why it's recommended that you know about aoi.js before you proceed viewing the guides.
